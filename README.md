# Actinium-Growth-Curves
Irradiation calculations for actinium growth curves. Ongoing edits by Glenn Clapp

The main script in this repository is the **Ac_growth_GUI.py**
The other necessary files are:
- A *.csv file containing the irradiation data
- Ac_growth.py

This set of programs is intended to help aide in the planning and execution actinium production campaigns by providing a way for operators to log irradiation data and run a report that generates a graph showing the prediction for the specified time frame.
